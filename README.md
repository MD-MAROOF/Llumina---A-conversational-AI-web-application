🧭 Important Note:
 This project is not deployed publicly to avoid unintended usage costs, as OpenAI’s API charges are usage-based. Deploying it publicly could result in unexpected expenses due to external usage. However, the application is fully functional and can be demonstrated locally or discussed in detail upon request.

Building Llumina has been a major milestone in my full-stack journey. It helped me explore AI integration, system design, scalability considerations, and real-world trade-offs developers face while working with paid APIs.

I’d really appreciate any feedback, suggestions, or reviews. If you’d like to know more about the project or see a live walkthrough, feel free to reach out!
